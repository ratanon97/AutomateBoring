This is the README file of my notes and codes on the Udemy course Automate The Boring Stuff With Python by Al Sweigart. This repository includes the downloaded files from the Automate The Boring Stuff With Python textbook as well as code templates for real-life applications. Codes were written on the Jupyter Notebook.
